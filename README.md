# ANALYSIS OF OLYMPICS DATASET
### 120 years of Olympic history from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016

**The notebook in this repo relies mostly on graphs to analyse the dataset**

This repo contains extensive data analysis of the olympics dataset using some of the most commonly used python libraries like **pandas, plotly, numpy, pandasql** and some other.

For most of the querying purposes I have used pandasql instead of pandas. The main reason for this is to imporve my SQL skills. All the things that have been done here using pandasql can be done relatively easily with pandas itself. 

You can find the dataset in the repo itself but I have also provided the link to the dataset [Click Here](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/notebooks)

I was also inspired from the works of Gabriel Preda on using plotly in this dataset. This is the link to his work [Click Here](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/plotly-tutorial-120-years-of-olympic-games)
